# Who Said It Best

An (extremely early) prototype of an (extremely silly) gameshow based on the (extremely unsupported) [Web Speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html). Created to present at [QueensJS 0o10](http://www.meetup.com/QueensJS/events/220945990/) on April 1, 2015.

## Why

I wanted to create a live game show where the constestants are judged by something even more arbitrary than people: a computer. Also, so I could learn a bunch of things I wanted to learn.

## Tech

In no particular order, some things are omitted, like, for instance, fire.

* WebkitSpeechRecognition API
* React
* Backbone
* Wordnik API
* express
* Ansible
